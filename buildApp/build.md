    - For basic Node.js projects: `node index.js  # Replace 'index.js' with your main script`
    - For complex projects with build tools (like webpack, Parcel, etc.): `npm run build`
- Run the Development Server:
     - For basic Node.js projects: `node index.js`
     - For comlex projecta with build tools: `npm run start`

### Building a GoLang Application
## Prerequisites:
- Go installed: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your OS.
- A Go module: Your project should be organized as a Go module. This is typically done by initializing a module in your project's root directory using the `go mod init` command.

- navigate to your project directory : `cd 'your project directory`
- Build the executable: `go build`
  This command will create an executable file in the current directory, typically named main or the same as your main package name.
  - Run the exceutable: `./your-executable-name`

## Using Build Tools:
- Makefiles: Create a Makefile to automate the build process.
- Example:\
  all:
          go build
 clean:
        rm -f main
- Build Tools: Use tools like make or bazel for more complex build scenarios.
